minitube (2.5.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Starting with 2.4, minitube supports the new YouTube API version 3.

  As this API version is the only one supprted by now, it is necessary to
  acquire an API key from Google.

  In order to do so, create a "Browser Key" at
  https://console.developers.google.com

  Minitube reads this key from the GOOGLE_API_KEY environment variable.

minitube (1.8-1) unstable; urgency=low

  Starting with 1.8-1, minitube no longer depends on a particular phonon
  backend, and can thus no longer directly depend on all codec-related
  packages.

  Users of the GStreamer backend might want to

  * apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good gstreamer0.10-x

  and maybe

  * apt-get install gstreamer0.10-ffmpeg gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad

  as well.

  The VLC backend seems to pull in all necessary dependencies by itself.
